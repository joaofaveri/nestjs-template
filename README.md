## Creating a repository from a template

You can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files as this repository. Creating a repository from a template is similar to forking a repository, , but there are important differences:

- A new fork includes the entire commit history of the parent repository, while a repository created from a template starts with a single commit.
- Commits to a fork don't appear in your contributions graph, while commits to a repository created from a template do appear in your contribution graph.
- A fork can be a temporary way to contribute code to an existing project, while creating a repository from a template starts a new project quickly.

Creating a repository from a template:

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the [main page](https://github.com/joaofaveri/nestjs-template) of the repository.
2. Above the file list, click **Use this template**.
3. Use the **Owner** drop-down menu, and select the account you want to own the repository.
4. Type a name for your repository, and an optional description.
5. Choose a repository visibility.
6. Optionally, to include the directory structure and files from all branches in the template, and not just the default branch, select **Include all branches**.
7. Optionally, if the personal account or organization in which you're creating uses any GitHub Apps from GitHub Marketplace, select any apps you'd like to use in the repository.
8. Click **Create repository from template**.
